# Brew formula for BlakeWilliams/remote-development-manager

This is a WIP, mostly for personal use but if it you find it useful let me know and I'll try to improve it ;)

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install franciscoj/remote-development-manager/remote-development-manager`

Or `brew tap franciscoj/remote-development-manager` and then `brew install remote-development-manager`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
